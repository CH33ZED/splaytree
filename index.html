<h1> Splay Trees! </h1>

<b> Splay Trees: A special type of binary search tree.
Space: O(n)
<br>
Average run time: O(logn)
<br>
<br>
Worst case: amortized O(logn), meaning some can take O(n) time to find, although this is rare.
<br>
<br>
Special Uses: Allows you to access recently used elements quicker. 
<br>
<br>
It “splays” with every search, moving the key you dealt with (or the parent of the key you deal with in case of removal) up toward the root.
